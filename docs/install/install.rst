**************************************************************************************
Install ROCm-LLMExt
**************************************************************************************

This topic provides brief guidance and recommendations on setting up your 
environment for LLM workloads. This includes verifying prerequisites before
installing ROCm-LLMExt libraries.

System requirements
======================================================================================

The ROCm-LLMExt libraries are all supported on AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs.
Individual components also support additional hardware configurations.

Before installing any of the ROCm-LLMExt libraries, verify that your system meets the hardware
and software prerequisites for each component as outlined in the :ref:`llmext-compat-matrix` page.

Install ROCm-LLMExt components
======================================================================================

Each component has distinct prerequisite and environment requirements. To avoid dependency
conflicts and configuration errors, components must be installed individually rather than
through a unified installation process.

The installation instructions for each component on ROCm can be found as follows:
