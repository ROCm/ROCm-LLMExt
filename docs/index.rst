AMD ROCm LLMExt documentation
********************************************************************

AMD ROCm LLMExt (ROCm-LLMExt) is an open-source software toolkit built
on the ROCm platform for large language model (LLM) extensions,
integrations, and performance enablement on AMD GPUs. The domain
brings together training, post-training, inference, and orchestration
components to make modern LLM stacks practical and reproducible on
AMD hardware.

.. note::

   ROCm-LLMExt 26.03 introduces a new component (Triton Inference Server) and includes targeted updates to one component (FlashInfer);
   five components remain unchanged (verl, Stanford Megatron-LM, Megablocks, Ray and llama.cpp).
